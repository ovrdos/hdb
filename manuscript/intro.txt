HOW DIET BEAT US

This book is the result of three years of research and a journey into the realm of health, wellness, diet and lifestyle. The research and real life practice that make up the material of this book has changed my life for the better. I realize everyone is on their own specific journey in life and certain conditions and other factors play a role in each personâ€™s journey to health. However, if the information in this book is taken in entirety and practiced carefully, anyone who takes this journey will benefit from its prescription.
